This page summarizes how to install Krux from four different ways.

- [From pre-built official release](../installing/from-pre-built-release.en.md)
- [From pre-built test release](../installing/from-test-release.en.md)
- [From GUI application](../installing/from-gui.en.md)
- [From source](../installing/from-source.en.md)

### Requirements

In any form, there is a basic requirement for all of them: You will need a K210-based device such as the M5StickV, Maix Amigo, Maix Dock, or Maix Bit and a USB-C cable to continue. Consult the [part list](../../parts.md) for more information.

After the first firmware install, if you wish to perform further airgapped updates or use other features that uses the SD card, you will also need a [supported microSD card](https://github.com/m5stack/m5-docs/blob/master/docs/en/core/m5stickv.md#tf-cardmicrosd-test). We cannot guarantee that a microSD card is compatible and will work in your device; you'll need to test it on the device to be sure.

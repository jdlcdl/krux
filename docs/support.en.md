## Ways you can help
### Development
Audit the code, file an issue, make a pull request, or do all three. :)

### Documentation
I'd like to see Krux help as many people as possible, and in order to do that it needs good documentation. If you see a better way to word something, please make a PR, no matter how small.

### Translation
Krux has support for different languages. If it's missing a language or has an awkward translation, please file an issue or make a PR!
You can also make a difference by helping to translate Krux's documentation to your native langue.

### Social
Reach out our Telegram groups or X profile listed below for quick help, share ideas and join the Krux community.
Help others get to know Krux.

### Donations
Krux won't ask for, receive, manage or distribute donations. You can donate to directly to a Krux contributor of your choice.

Thank you!
